## Advice on Writing

There is a ton of writing advice out there. Some exceptional advice is found below.

### How to Write a Lot

Prof. Huff loved
[this book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Lot-Practical-Productive/dp/1591477433/ref=la_B001JP2K08_1_1)
as a postdoc. **The main lesson is that you should
write every day, not in occasional bursts.**

### Create a Writing Habit

Here are some recommendations to help you make a habit of writing everyday:
1. The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is
a powerful method for doing focused, deep, work. There are several apps you could
download to use this technique.
- [GNU Pomodoro](https://gnomepomodoro.org/) is an open source timer for Linux OS.
- [Tomighty](https://tomighty.github.io/) timer is an open source timer for Windows/Mac OS.
- A standard kitchen or watch timer also works!
2. Use full screen word processor that blocks all distractions.
- [FocusWriter](https://gottcode.org/focuswriter/) is a free, open source,
full screen word processor that can track daily goals, has built-in timers, and
colorful themes. Available on Ubuntu, Mac, or Windows.
- [ColdTurkeyWriter](https://getcoldturkey.com/writer/) is the **nuclear option** of
word processors. Once you open the app and set a goal (time or word count) 
you *cannot* exit the app until the goal is completed. Caveats: Only the basic version is
free (though you don't need much more), it's only available on Windows/Mac.
3. Have a distraction-free word processor open on computer start up. Doing this
forces you to write a certain number of words or for a certain length of time
before you can do anything else!

### Stanford MOOC on Writing in the Sciences

Prof. Huff's [writing checklist](/manual/guides/writing/checklist) is mostly from advice in this  [massively open online course](https://online.stanford.edu/course/writing-sciences-self-paced-spring-2016). You can take it yourself, for free, at your own pace.
