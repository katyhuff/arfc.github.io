This guide provides best practices for ensuring that plots created by ARFC are
accessible and visually clear. By following these simple recommendations, you
will make your work more inclusive, readable, and aligned with accessibility
standards.

## 0. Labels, Captions, and Context

First of all, it must be made abundantly clear what information is being 
conveyed in the plot. The plot should have a caption (and/or a title), axis labels, and 
a legend, at minimum. 

### 0.1 Caption

Every plot must have a caption. 
In an ideal world, the first part of the caption also acts as the title of the figure. 
That is, the title is usually not shown above the figure (as you might do for a 
table). Instead, the title is the first sentence, or so, or the caption block.  
LaTeX does this automatically if you use the syntax below. This syntax allows 
the Short Title to appear before the longer caption description and also for 
the Short Title be used in the list of figures or table of contents at the 
front of the document. 

```
\caption[Short Title]%
{Short Title - Long Description}
```

The title should convey the main idea (Wall temperature variation over time.) 
while the caption should provide sufficient context (The temperature at the 
midpoint of the inner wall of the pressure vessel was measured with ACME 
thermocouples from Hot Zero Power to the end of the reactor transient. The peak 
temperature was experienced at t=340 seconds.)


### 0.2 Axis Labels
All axes (x, y, z, twin, etc.) must have a clear label. This typically includes 
an English name for the value, a symbol representing the value, and units. For 
example:

```
$m_U $Uranium Mass(kg)



### 0.3 Legend



## 1. Using Color

Color combinations like red, green, brown, orange, and yellow can be difficult
to distinguish for people. Instead, use distinguishable patterns and contrast;
different line styles, shapes, and markers can help differentiate elements
without relying on color.

This does not mean you cannot employ a color pallette, **Sequential palettes**
should be used for data with a natural order (e.g., temperature), while
**diverging palettes** are better suited for data with two distinct extremes.
Popular accessible color palettes include **Cividis**, **Viridis**, and
**Inferno**, which are perceptually uniform. Avoid the Jet (rainbow)
colormap, as it is not perceptually uniform. It often causes difficulty in
interpreting data, as colors that are close to each other can look almost
identical, while distant colors may appear too different.


## 2. Choosing Font

Choose sans-serif fonts (like **Arial**, **Helvetica**, **Verdana**), as they
are generally easier to read compared to serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman).In
addition to a good font, your text should also have enough contrast against the
background for readability.
- For headings, the contrast ratio should be at least 3:1.
- For body text, the contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1.

Avoid fonts with narrow letter spacing or uneven height (between lowercase and
uppercase) as they exacerbate all of the above problems. Keep text, whitespace,
and figures evenly spaced, allowing for easy zooming and reading.

## 3. Use of Markers and Line Styles

To ensure that your plots will stand the test of time by using non-color-based
visual cues like:
- Markers (e.g., circles, squares, triangles) to differentiate data points.
- Line styles (e.g., dashed, dotted, solid) to distinguish data in a line plot.

This will help ensure that even if a user has difficulty distinguishing certain
colors, they can still interpret the plot accurately.


## 4. Plot Size and Resolution

Make sure your plots are high resolution so that details are not lost when
zooming in. In addition to a high resolution your plots should be high-quality
formats (e.g., **SVG**, **PDF**).


## 5. Matplotlib Style File for ARFC

To standardize the style of your plots, you can use a **Matplotlib style file**
that reflects ARFC's standards. This will help ensure that all plots follow the
same formatting conventions, making them visually consistent and aligned with
our standards.

You can use this style file to configure:
- font,
- color palettes,
- plot dimensions,
- and figure size.

A Matplotlib style file is available here:
https://gist.github.com/nsryan2/456490df118ab3318ec07c7610432e69.
It uses Paul Tol's muted qualitative color scheme as the default.

### Example:

Here's a minimal example of how you can apply the style file to Python:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the ARFC style file
plt.style.use('path/to/plotting.mplstyle')

# Create a sample plot
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y1 = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
y2 = [2, 3, 9, 16, 26]

plt.plot(x, y1, label='Sample 1', marker='o', linestyle='-')
plt.plot(x, y2, label='Sample 2', marker='+', linestyle='--')

plt.xlabel('X Axis')
plt.ylabel('Y Axis')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## 6. Inkscape

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/about/) is a free vector graphics editor. 
Its most notable feature is allowing for precise dimensions and units 
for creating shapes, ensuring all figures are to scale. It is especially
helpful when creating graphics that aren't easily made
automatically. Graphics are automatically saved as .svg files, but Inkscape 
also supports .pdf and .png files. While creating graphics, 
follow all [accessibility standards](https://arfc.github.io/manual/guides/writing/)
regarding font, lifestyle, and color.

## 7. Tikz

[Tikz](https://tikz.dev/) is a LaTeX package that allows for the creation of figures
directly within your documents. Tikz is especially useful for creating diagrams 
and flow charts. It uses coordinates to plot each shape within the figure, ensuring 
everything within the figure has precise dimensions. 

A minimal example of how to use tikz in a document:
````Latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[red, very thick] (0,2) circle (3cm); %% Circle at (0,2) w/ radius 3cm
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
````

Tikz tutorials and documentation can be found both on the 
[website](https://tikz.dev/tutorials-guidelines) and on 
[overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package). Further examples
of figures made within Tikz can be viewed inthe Latex/Tikz
[Gallary](https://texample.net/). Follow all the
[accessibility standards](https://arfc.github.io/manual/guides/writing/) 
regarding font, lifestyle, color, markers,and contrast while creating figures.
